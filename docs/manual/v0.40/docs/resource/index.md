# Resources

Resource is any external file used by a pico-Céu application, such as images, fonts, and audio files. Every resource should be located in a ```res``` folder, in the root of the application, and can be used in [`GRAPHICS_DRAW_BMP`](#graphics_draw_bmp), [`GRAPHICS_SET_FONT`](#graphics_set_font), or [`SOUND_PLAY`](#sound_play).
